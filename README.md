# The Art of Computer Science

Computer Science concepts from first principles. 

## Intro

"We need to do away with the myth that computer science is about computers. Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes, biology is about microscopes or chemistry is about beakers and test tubes. Science is not about tools, it is about how we use them and what we find out when we do."

-- Michael R. Fellows and Ian Parberry, Computing Research News (1993)

Computers are everywhere, whether we are consciously aware of them or not. They are embedded in airplanes, spaceships, in factories and even in everyday items like cameras and refrigerators. They help us with critical infracture, transportation, finance, communication, how we receive health care, and in the pursuit of new knowledge. Computers have helped us tremendously in our daily lives as well, they have changed the way we learn, shop, travel and entertain ourselves. Computers are one of the most versatile tools we have ever invented. 

But for all the good they have done us, computers are really just dumb machines. It is us humans who program these machines to do our bidding. They amplify our ingenuity by tirelessly executing our intructions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 

The goal of this repo is to empower you to teach computers to solve problems. As you may know, computers execute your instructions precisely, even your mistakes. And by necessity, you must be more precise and intentional than you may be used to. 

Although this repo should be language-agnostic, I use Python to convey computer science ideas. This might change in the future though.
